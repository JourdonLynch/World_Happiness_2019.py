# World_Happiness_2019

World happiness data from 2019 was analyzed using the pandas library to assess the correlation between the happiness score of a country and various factors. Data points were visualized as a scatterplot using the seaborn and matplotlib sub-libraries. Trendlines were generated on each plot with data points colored using a diverging green-red palette.
